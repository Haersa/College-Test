In the SEO branch, I used semantic HTML tags to boost SEO ranking within the browser and allow screen readers to index the page & read it more easily. This mainly included adding `<article>` tags, `<strong>` tags, `<section>` tags instead of many `<div>` tags and also utilising proper heading tags, making sure there is only one `<h1>` tag on the page. 

I also added keyword, author and description meta tags to give browsers an easier time recognising what the site is based on and its purpose. This will improve browser ranking.

*This is not a serious project, it is a test project within college to learn git functionality like pull requests etc.*
